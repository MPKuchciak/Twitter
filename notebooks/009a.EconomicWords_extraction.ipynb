    "**Objective**: To accurately identify and flag tweets discussing economic topics from English-translated Polish Twitter data, based on a predefined list of 56 economic keywords and multi-word expressions (MWEs), while minimizing false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**: A hybrid natural language processing (NLP) approach was implemented, integrating efficient string matching with contextual linguistic analysis using the spaCy library (en_core_web_lg model). The process involves several stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The predefined list of economic terms was separated into single words and MWEs.-\n",
    "2. An Aho-Corasick automaton was built for efficient matching of the exact MWE sequences (case-insensitive).\n",
    "3. Single keywords were lemmatized using spaCy, and a dictionary (target_lemmas) was created mapping each base lemma (lowercase) to its corresponding original keyword(s).\n",
    "4. Tweet Processing Pipeline: Each tweet's text (text_clean_en) was processed as follows:\n",
    "    a) MWE Matching: The Aho-Corasick automaton identified all occurrences of predefined MWEs within the tweet text (case-insensitive). These matches were recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) SpaCy Linguistic Analysis: The tweet text was processed by spaCy to obtain tokenization, lemmatization, Part-of-Speech (POS) tags (Universal POS tags like NOUN, VERB, PROPN), and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags (like ORG, MONEY).\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) Contextual Span Identification: Character indices covered by specific non-economic named entities (e.g., 'Europarlament' tagged as ORG) defined in a blocklist (NON_ECONOMIC_ORG_ENTITIES) were pre-calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Filtered Lemma Matching: Each token in the spaCy-processed tweet was evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Tokens overlapping with already matched MWEs were skipped.\n",
    "        - Tokens overlapping with the pre-identified non-economic entity spans were ignored (NER Filter).\n",
    "\n",
    "    e) For the remaining tokens, the lowercase lemma (token.lemma_.lower()) was checked against the target_lemmas dictionary.\n",
    "        If a lemma match occurred, an additional POS filter was applied only if the lemma was present as a key in a predefined RELEVANT_POS_TAGS dictionary. This dictionary specifies allowed POS tags (e.g., {'NOUN', 'PROPN'} for 'bank') for ambiguous keywords like names of institutions. If the token's token.pos_ was not in the allowed set for that lemma, the match was ignored.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    f) Matches passing all filters were recorded, storing both the original token text and the corresponding base keyword(s)).\n",
    "        Post-hoc Filtering: After initial flagging based on the refined extraction, a final filtering step was applied. Rows where the only matched base keywords were 'equality' or 'inequalities' (or both) were identified and removed entirely from the dataset. This aimed to exclude tweets discussing social/gender equality rather than economic equality when no other economic context was present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: The process yields final lists of matched base keywords (matched_keywords_FILTERED) and extracted original word forms (extracted_terms_FILTERED) for each tweet, along with a final boolean flag (has_econ_term_FILTERED reflecting the state after the post-hoc removal) indicating whether the tweet contains relevant economic terms according to this refined procedure."

    "In order to find economic discourse in downloaded tweets, we created keyword-based classification technique that goes beyond basic string matching. This method utilizes a predetermined list of multi-word expressions (MWEs) and economic terms. It combines spaCy-based lemmatization to capture morphological variants, such as verb forms and plurals with the Aho-Corasick algorithm for effective matching of multi-word phrases. Importantly, spaCy's linguistic features are used to apply contextual filters that remove uncertainty from meaning of keyword matches. Filters aim to apply Part-of-Speech tag restrictions for ambiguous keywords, such as separating noun uses of \"bank\" from verb uses, and ignore matches that exist within specific non-economic Named Entities, like \"Europarlament.\" To eliminate likely non-economic social contexts, a final post-hoc adjustment removes tweets where the only keywords found were \"equality\" or \"inequalities.\", which after manual inspection were discorvered as relating only to social topics. Compared to simpler keyword or lemma-only approaches, this hybrid method yields a more accurate classification of tweets relevant to the target economic vocabulary by reducing contextually inappropriate matches while maintaining recall through lemmatization.

    "Following the identification of economic tweets, we visualizated and analysed results to understand the characteristics and distribution of this discourse. \n",
    "\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Analysis: The volume of economic tweets is plotted over time (e.g., weekly counts), with key events such as the 2023 Polish election annotated with vertical lines and pre/post periods highlighted using shaded regions to observe potential shifts in discourse volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword Popularity: The most and least frequent economic keywords from the final filtered list are identified and visualized using bar charts, providing insights into the dominant themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Comparison: The performance and output of the final refined keyword extraction method are compared against simpler exact-match techniques (Naive, Regex, FlashText, Aho-Corasick) and aggregated approaches (Union, Gateway). This involves comparing total flagged tweet counts, analyzing overlaps and differences in flagged sets (e.g., via Venn diagrams of top tokens and detailed examination of disagreement samples), and assessing keyword frequencies unique to each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Party-Level Discourse: The economic discourse is further analyzed by political party affiliation. This includes visualizing the top economic tokens used by each party (via grouped and stacked bar charts) and plotting the share (percentage) of each party's total tweets that were flagged as economic by different methods (Union, Gateway, and Final Refined).\n",
    "\n",
    "Top Contributors: Analysis is conducted to identify the top individuals (users/authors) contributing to economic discourse within each party and overall, based on both the raw number and the percentage of their tweets flagged as economic. These are visualized using bar charts sorted within parties and globally."

    "##### **5. Refined Keyword Extraction (Lemmatization + MWE + Contextual Filters)** - current method used for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach aims to accurately identify economic discourse by combining efficient multi-word matching, linguistic normalization (lemmatization), and contextual filtering to improve precision over simpler methods. It leverages spaCy for deep linguistic analysis. (Requires spacy, ahocorasick, pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Preparation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keywords are split into Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) and single words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An Aho-Corasick automaton is built for fast, case-insensitive matching of exact MWEs (Multi-Word Expression; sequences of two or more words that funciton as a single unit in some way).\n",
    "Single words are lemmatized (e.g., \"taxes\" -> \"tax\"), and a dictionary maps these base lemmas (lowercase) back to the original keyword(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extraction & Filtering per Tweet:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exact MWEs are identified using Aho-Corasick.\n",
    "- The tweet text is processed with spaCy to get tokens with lemmas, Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags.\n",
    "- Single word matches are found by comparing the lowercase lemma of each spaCy token to the target lemma dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Contextual Filters Applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NER Filter: Matches are ignored if the token belongs to a predefined non-economic Named Entity (e.g., ignoring 'euro' if part of 'Europarlament' tagged as ORG).\n",
    "- POS Filter: Matches for specific ambiguous keywords (e.g., 'bank', 'finance', 'equality') are ignored if the token's POS tag (e.g., VERB) is not in a predefined set of allowed tags (RELEVANT_POS_TAGS) for that keyword's lemma. This requires careful tuning.\n",
    "- The results combine matched MWEs and single words that passed the contextual filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Post-hoc Row Removal: Tweets where the only keywords identified by the above refined process were 'equality' or 'inequalities' are removed entirely from the dataset to filter out likely non-economic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: The final output includes a boolean flag (has_econ_term_FILTERED in the modified DataFrame) indicating relevance based on this process, the list of matched base keywords (matched_keywords_FILTERED), and the originally extracted text fragments (extracted_terms_FILTERED).\n",
    "**Benefit**: Significantly improves precision compared to basic keyword/lemma matching by actively filtering contextually irrelevant uses, while lemmatization helps maintain recall for different word forms. Requires tuning of NER/POS filter rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ADDITIONAL:** Refined Keyword Extraction (Brief Summary / Abstract)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method identifies economic keywords in tweets using a hybrid NLP approach to enhance contextual relevance. It combines Aho-Corasick for multi-word expressions, spaCy-based lemmatization for word variants, and crucially applies contextual filters based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) (e.g., excluding keywords within 'Europarlament') and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging (e.g., distinguishing noun vs. verb uses for words like 'finance'). A final step removes tweets solely containing 'equality'/'inequalities'. This approach yields higher precision than simpler keyword methods by reducing contextually inappropriate matches."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**All‑MiniLM-L6-v2:** A general-purpose model that efficiently captures semantic similarity across a wide range of topics.\n",

This method allows to detect economic-related content even if tweets do not contain specific keywords or include false matches like \"europarlament.\" Instead of relying solely on keyword presence, the similarity score measures how close a tweet's meaning is to an averaged economic concept derived from a curated list of economic words.\n",

To compare these, a 3-way Venn diagram illustrates the overlap and differences among the top keywords found by these three distinct approaches. \n",
