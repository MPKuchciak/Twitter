## Project Overview:
The project aims to analyse the sentiment of Polish politicians' statements on the X platform (formerly Twitter), in the context of examining their communication strategies in social media. The analysis covers all political parties represented in the Sejm of the 10th term, provided that they have at least 10 members. The research methodology combines a lexical approach (VADER) withadvanced natural language processing (NLP) models such as BERT. In the reasearch was performed EDA, Sentiment Analysis, Clustering, Network Analysis and Hate Speech Detection.
