# --- Handling the 'data' folder ---
# The 'data' folder itself and its subdirectories (like '05_final') will be tracked
# if they contain any files not ignored by the rules above (e.g., *.parquet).
# To ensure the 'data' folder and its subfolders (like '05_final') are tracked
# even if they ONLY contain files that are ignored (like .parquet files),
# you should place an empty file named '.gitkeep' inside each such directory.
# For example:
#   data/.gitkeep
#   data/05_final/.gitkeep
#   data/some_other_subfolder_to_track/.gitkeep

# Un-ignore .gitkeep files everywhere within 'data/' to allow tracking of directory structure.
!data/**/.gitkeep

# If you have other specific files or types WITHIN 'data/' that are NOT covered by
# global ignores but you want to ignore them, add those rules here:
# e.g., data/some_folder/*.temp_output

# If you have specific files within 'data/' that ARE covered by global ignores
# (like *.csv or *.parquet) but you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TRACK THEM (e.g., they are critical inputs),
# you must explicitly un-ignore them with a '!' rule AFTER the global ignore.
# Example (use with caution, ensure they are not generated outputs):
# !data/critical_input_data/input.parquet
